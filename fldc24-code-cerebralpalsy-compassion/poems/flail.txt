When you told me you loved the symphony
I felt my heart beat in pizzicato
We were dancing across vibrating strings
Caked with the rozen of the universe
Passing knowledge like secret dances by moonlight

Come, dance with me
Let me conduct a symphony just for you
I’ll record it in sunsets and starlight so you can always find your way home

I’ve been conducting symphonies my entire life
Hoping that you will hear them and come to investigate
Come to see - the beauty that is sound flowing from my hands into the vast ether
Flailing about as though signaling tenacity to the gods

Sometimes I flail (by sometimes I mean all the time)
Sometimes I flail, and my fingertips kiss your favorite wine glass
You didn’t know it was your favorite until you watched it falling from the counter
Dancing away it’s final moments in one last burst of passion before
Crashing into the floor like a symbol (cymbal)
Smashing into the pieces of my shame that are impossible to pick up
My symphonies only end in chaos
My symphonies only end In the reality that I cannot be trusted
I am an unrelenting force that leaves destruction in it’s wake
I am disappointed that cannot go unpunished
I am a problem

But, as we were picking up the shards
Placing them carefully into the box where our memories will forget
I said I was sorry
And you
You told me this was your favorite symphony yet
It was just glass
And I am just skin and bones and love
And flailing chaos

Come, flail with me
Maybe we can make a symphony together
