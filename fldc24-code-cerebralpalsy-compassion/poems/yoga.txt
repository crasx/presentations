When the yoga mat refuses to unfurl
I place a bolster at its head
Blocks at my feet
I build a fortress where nobody can see
I close my eyes so that not even I can see
A smile.

In highschool my poetry teacher asked us what we hated the most about ourselves

And I said, my smile
Like when I’ve fallen head over heels
and my mind is running through the 100 ways I find you beautiful -
You can see it in my smile
In my uncontrollable lopsided excuse for an expression of joy

One of the most beautiful girls I have ever met told the teacher she hated her nose
But she - she was sculpted from a perfection impossible of ever holding any type of flaw
She was worthy of feeling beautiful because she was beautiful
And I was not

When the yoga mat refuses to unfurl
I know that this means my body will not listen
I will ask my muscles to stop twitching
Beg my breath to go unnoticed
Ask my mind to find acceptance

I am not a goddess,
No matter how badly I want to be one
I am not water flowing from the mountains
I am not a lotus, or a warrior, or a downward facing dog

I am a twitching mess of half poses
I am a forward fold that will never touch my toes
I am a breath, shifting through foreign spaces that will only leave me starved of air

There are things I hate more about myself than my smile.

When the yoga mat refuses to unfurl
I recognize it, and I set my intention

I attempt to forgive myself
I am actively forgiving myself
    I am telling myself that I am enough
    That my disability has no say in my beauty
    And That the only thing holding me back from being a goddess is myself
    I have learned on this mat that
    I can be whoever the fuck I need to be
        and that at that precise moment
        I am exactly as I should be
    I have learned on this mat that I am the only one
        who knows what it means to live in this body
    And as a result I am the only one who can truly love it and care for it
        and forgive it for existing
    I have learned on this mat that I am brave
        And I am beautiful
        And I deserve to receive as much love as I give
        And that anyone that doesn't give me love
         shouldn't get to be a part of this beauty

When my yoga mat refuses to unfurl
I smile
I bow deeply to it’s honesty
And I forgive it
because I know it will forgive me too
